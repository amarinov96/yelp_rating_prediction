# Simple Sentiment Analysis on Yelp Reviews
This project is a sentiment analysis done on [Yelp reviews](https://www.yelp.com/dataset). We compared the performance of a few models in predicting the rating using other information/features given, such as review text, business location, user id, etc. The performance was measured by the RMSE between the predicted ratings and the actual ratings in reviews. 
The results were compiled as a short paper in the pdf file.
